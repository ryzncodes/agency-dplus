## **Notes**

**The smoke cursor is implemented using WebGL. On low-performance devices or outdated browsers, this effect may slow down the site or display incorrectly.** <br/> <br/>
**To disable the cursor locally, go to the root page `app/page.tsx` and disable the ` <ShadowCursor />` component**

This site is completely made using VW units (view width). [More](https://www.sitepoint.com/css-viewport-units-quick-start/)
